# Note-Taker

The point of this challenge/assignment was to create a Note Taker.

1. The purpose of this challenge was to create a note taker using Express.js

2. After the user clicks the get started button, they are able to add the title of their note and a note that 
   displays on the left of the application. 

3. The delete button isn't quite up and running but that doesn't affect the functionality of the application.
